# NLP - Neural Machine Translation using Encoder Decoder

we are going to perform machine translation using two deep learning approaches: a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Transformer.

Specifically, we are going to train sequence to sequence models for Spanish to English translation. Here we implement the neural network models.
